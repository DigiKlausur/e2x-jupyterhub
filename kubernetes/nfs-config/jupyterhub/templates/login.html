Then go to localhost:30300 in your browser.\n  - Via university vpn: Follow this instruction: https://ux-2s18.inf.h-brs.de/faq-1/vpn , connect to the vpn and open your browser and go to IP:30300.\n\nThe new IP address is accessible from the day when this information is generated.\n\n\n*NOTE: If you use ssh, your local port should be the same as the one in the upstream servers, which is 30300. If they are different, some JupyterHub functionality may break!.");
